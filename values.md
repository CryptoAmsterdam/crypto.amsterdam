# Values

- Any tool we can't read; we won't trust. Any software should be publicly
    readable on it's critical parts. 
- Information should be concise and clear. We are here to help and educate
    others. This isn't to show off how smart you are. 
- We know one thing; that we know nothing. Your text does not represent you,
    everything is open for improvement.
