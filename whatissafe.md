# What do we consider safe software

As long as companies claim to be secure and promise not to share your
information with others: you can't trust them. 

Any software you use, should have it's code used by our devices publicly
reviewable by others. 

Only this way it can be verified for not having backdoors, and assure any data
leaving your device is encrypted, and only accessible by you, or your peers. 

Even if companies are willingly to keep data private, they may be forced by law
to grant access to your privacy. Therefor you can never trust them. 

These lists are not a complete lists, merely an indication your privacy can not
guaranteed with them.
