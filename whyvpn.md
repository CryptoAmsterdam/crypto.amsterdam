# Why you always need a VPN

When you're out on a public WiFi, intercepting what you do on the internet is a
piece of cake. With not much effort, we can see your bank login and whom you're
chatting with. 
Even when you don't see a creepy dude with a laptop covered in Russian
stickers, evil intended can install malware on phones/computers that spy this
traffic without the knowledge of the device owner. 

A VPN will send all your internet behaviour encrypted over the WiFi, making it
useless for others to intercept your connection. 

Only connect to passwordless WiFi without VPN when you're confident all devices
around are trusted.
