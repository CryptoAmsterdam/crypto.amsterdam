        We are Crypto Amsterdam. <br><br>
        
        We believe the next world war goes beyond borders of politics, but
        targets our digital identity and freedom of speech.<br>
        This Trump could be the triumph of many Trumps. And there is no
        guarantee that any country's future leaders won't abuse today's
        openness.<br><br>

        Resistance to bad politics isn't done by weapons of destruction.
        Borders will always move or change, while The Internet will always
        persist.<br>
        Sharing knowledge on secure communication is the only way to guarantee
        the freedom of this network and borderless world.<br><br>

        We distrust any organization claiming to be trustful with our privacy,  
        and solely rely on tools that are secure by design with end-to-end
        encryption, and publicly reviewable source code. <br>

        It is our mission to make safe communication understood by everyone,
        and make the concepts just as simple part of our day as locking our
        house doors. <br>
        We show you the right tools, without sacrificing usability.  With the
        ultimate dream to make encryption part of the elementary school's
        curriculum. <br><br>

        With everyone connected securely, we can continue the freedom of speech
        and knowledge the internet has brought us. <br>

        We are the resistance, <br>
        we are crypto.amsterdam.
